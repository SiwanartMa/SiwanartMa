## Hi there 👋
I'm Siwanart, a UK-based bioinformatician specialising in automating next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis pipelines for biomedical research in academia and biotech. I develop workflows to analyse complex omics data and leverage machine learning for genomic insights, bridging computational analysis with a strong background in molecular biology.

**Programming Languages**  
Proficient in Python, R, Nextflow, Bash (shell scripting), and SQL (MySQL) for bioinformatics scripting, data analysis, and pipeline development.

**Tech Stack**
1. Pipeline development and NGS data analysis  
   - Built Nextflow pipelines to automate image processing and single-cell/spatial transcriptomics analysis on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters ([Project Link](https://github.com/Spagnoli-Lab/spatial_pancreas_community_pipeline)). Developed an interactive results atlas for data visualisation ([Pancreatic Spatial & Single-Cell Transcriptomics Atlas](https://spatial-pancreatic-maps.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/))
   - Facilitated external barcode alignment and annotation by customising GTF and FASTA to build a reference genome.
2. Machine Learning  
   Curated datasets and trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to optimise adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid design for gene therapy. Fine-tuned deep learning models (MicroSAM) via transfer learning to segment biological images (Drosophila tissue).
3. Databases and API  
   Created [OTxplore-R](https://github.com/wrashed/OTxplore-R) to integrate drug–target–disease associations from the Open Targets Platform API, parsing JSON outputs into structured datasets for network visualisation.
   
**Biology Background**  
Three years of wet-lab research in gene therapy, providing a strong foundation in molecular biology and cross-functional collaboration with wet-lab teams.
